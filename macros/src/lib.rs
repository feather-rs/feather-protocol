//! Procedural macro to read in a protocol definition
//! and output code to read/write each packet.
//!
//! This macro works in stages, inspired by rustc/typical
//! compiler architecture:
//! AST: `syn::ItemMod` containing all the packet structs and field attributes.
//! High-level intermediate representation (HIR): a more processed version of the `ItemMod`.
//! Mid-level intermediate representation (MIR): a lower level structure intended for use
//! by the code generator (the next stage). Different versions of packets are "monomorphized".
//! Code generator: writes out final Rust code.
//!
//! Transitioning from one stage to another is referred to as "lowering."
